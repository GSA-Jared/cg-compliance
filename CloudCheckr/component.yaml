    18F has implemented CloudWatch for its system account monitoring. It monitors
    resources in near real-time, including EC2 instances, EBS volumes, Elastic Load
    Balancers, and RDS DB instances. Metrics such as CPU utilization, latency, and
    request counts are provided automatically for these AWS resources. It allows 18F
    to supply logs or custom application and system metrics, such as memory usage,
    transaction volumes, or error rates.

    CloudTrail captures all IAM API calls from  command-line tools, the AWS SDK, and
    the AWS Management Console. Monitoring data is retained for two weeks, even if
    AWS resources have been terminated. This enables 18F to quickly look back at the
    metrics preceding an event of interest.

    Metrics are accessed in either the EC2 tab or the CloudWatch tab of the AWS Management
    Console. Secops personnel monitors the use of all infrastructure accounts  through
    Cloud Checkr

  narrative: 'Cloud Checkr provides a unified view of all infrastructure monitoring
    which captures all remote activities within 18F virtual infrastructure. The log
    files are organized by AWS Account ID, region, service name, date, and time. CloudTrail
    can be configured to aggregate log files from multiple regions into a single Amazon
    S3 bucket. From there, 18F Devops and SecOps teams view the logs files within
    Cloud Checkr to perform security analysis and detect user behavior patterns.
