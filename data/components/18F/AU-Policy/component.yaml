          Audit logs will be made available to organizations for mutual support in response to security breaches, system and user access, incident reporting and continuous monitoring.
          18F will generate and distribute audit reports, provide customized dashoard access for audited events, and send audit log data to SIEM and log analysis systems from its  audit logging and metrics tools for the Cloud.Gov platform and virtual infrastructure as needed.
        c: |
          18F retains audit logs according to NARA retention standards to provide support for after-the-fact investigations of security incidents and to meet regulatory and organizational information retention requirements.
          The log management framework will provide the capability to retain logs for 90 days online and one-year offline, with sufficient capacity as to mitigate the risk of exceeding storage space.
          Specific Policies, Procedures, Points of Contact, and Guidance will be established between 18F and other agencies to support after-the-fact investigations, by the 18F Project Lead.

        Created draft 18F Audit and Accounting policy  which states in section 3--
        Audit Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting
        - 18F establishes processes for regularly reviewing audit log information, and reporting security issues if discovered. Reviews will occur at a minimum of weekly. These processes are integrated with processes for incident response, in order to ensure standardization and cross-functional collaboration
        - 18F employs automated mechanisms to integrate audit monitoring, analysis and reporting into an overall process for investigation and response to suspicious activities.
        - 18F employs automated mechanisms to immediately alert security personnel of inappropriate or unusual activities that have security implications.

          AWS Auditable Events:
          DevOps and SecOps teams will conduct weekly manual and automated continuous audits of authorized accounts and configurations. These audits will include but are not limited to:
          Administrative Accounts
          * Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
          * Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
          * Simple Storage Service (S3)
          * Identity and Access Management (IAM)
          * Elastic Block Store (EBS)


          Cloud Foundry Auditable Events:
          By default, Loggregator streams logs to a terminal. 18F will drain logs to a third-party log management service such as ELK and AWS CloudTrail
          Cloud Foundry logs are captured in multiple tables and log files. These will be reviewed weekly and if discovery of anomalous audit log content which appears to indicate a breach are handled according to the GSA Security Incident Handling Guide: CIO IT Security 01-02 Revision 7 (August 18, 2009) requirements.

        b: |
          When a credible source to the GSA Agency provides information that causes reason to enhance audit activities, develop and implement an enhanced auditing use-case that will adequately enhance auditing practices in a fashion necessary per the identified threat and following the Incident Reporting Procedures in GSA IT Security Procedural Guide 01-02 (04/07/2015), Incident Response. The GSA Agency may also, through analysis pertaining to the GSA Agency environment provide additional audit measures that will require an increase in review, analysis, and reporting for a necessary.
          Upon implementation, 18F will monitor information security news and alerts for indications of a need to heighten information system security monitoring.
